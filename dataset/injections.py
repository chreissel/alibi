"""Build whitened, labelled 2-channel examples: [strain, witness].

For each class the strain channel uses real interferometer background; the witness
channel is synthesised. Signals are injected into strain only; glitches are coupled
into both strain and witness (see ``witness.py``); background is noise only. A fourth
``signal_glitch`` class injects a coincident signal and blip together (signal in strain
only, blip in both channels), modelling a real signal contaminated by a glitch.

Adapted from chreissel/GWDatasetGeneration, extended with a witness channel, a glitch
class, and a combined signal+glitch class.
